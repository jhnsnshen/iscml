  address = {Cannes, France},
  month = {Sept.},
  abstract = {In a three-node wireless relay network, two nodes, {BS1} and {BS2,}
	exchange information through a relay node, {RL.} Suppose time division
	duplex is used, physical network coding {(PNC)} uses two time slots
	for the information exchange instead of four time slots needed by
	the conventional method. In the first time slot, both {BS1} and {BS2}
	transmit simultaneously to {RL.} The relay node, {RL} does a {PNC}
	mapping based on the received signal and broadcast the mapped signal
	back to {BS1} and {BS2} simultaneously during the second time slot.
	The nodes, {BS1} and {BS2} are able to decode their desired information
	based on the received mapped signal and the signal which they had
	transmitted during the first time slot. In this paper, we analyze
	the average {BER} of the information exchanged between the two nodes
	in Rayleigh fading environments. We also derive the average {BER}
	of the mapped signal at the relay during the first time slot. With
	the derived {BER} of the mapped signal at {RL,} we propose to use
	power control at {BS1} and {BS2} to minimize the instantaneous {BER}
	of the mapped signal at {RL.} The proposed technique improves the
	{BER} of the desired information decoded at the two nodes. The solution
	turns out to be channel inversion based power control at both {BS1}
	and {BS2.} The proposed power control technique improves both the
	average {BER} of the mapped signal at {RL} and the desired information
	at {BS1} and {BS2.}},

	the achievable throughput in multi-hop wireless networks by applying
	network coding over bi-directional traffic flows. We term each such
	technique as bi-directional amplification of throughput {(BAT)-relaying.}
	While network coding is normally performed by combining decoded packets,
	here we introduce a relaying method based on amplify-and-forward
	{(AF),} where the relay node utilizes the inherent combining of packets
	provided by simultaneous transmissions over a multiple access channel.
	Under low noise levels, {AF} {BAT-relaying} offers a superior throughput
	performance. The unconventionality of {AF} {BAT} relaying opens many
	possibilities for further research},

  abstract = {A main distinguishing feature of a wireless network compared with
	a wired network is its broadcast nature, in which the signal transmitted
	by a node may reach several other nodes, and a node may receive signals
	from several other nodes simultaneously. Rather than a blessing,
	this feature is treated more as an interference-inducing nuisance
	in most wireless networks today (e.g., {IEEE} 802.11). The goal of
	this paper is to show how the concept of network coding can be applied
	at the physical layer to turn the broadcast property into a capacity-boosting
	advantage in wireless ad hoc networks. Specifically, we propose a
	physical-layer network coding {(PNC)} scheme to coordinate transmissions
	among nodes. In contrast to "straightforward" network coding which
	performs coding arithmetic on digital bit streams after they have
	been received, {PNC} makes use of the additive nature of simultaneously
	arriving electromagnetic {(EM)} waves for equivalent coding operation.
	{PNC} can yield higher capacity than straight-forward network coding
	when applied to wireless networks. We believe this is a first paper
	that ventures into {EM-wave-based} network coding at the physical
	layer and demonstrates its potential for boosting network capacity.
	{PNC} opens up a whole new research area because of its implications
	and new design requirements for the physical, {MAC,} and network
	layers of ad hoc wireless stations. The resolution of the many outstanding
	but interesting issues in {PNC} may lead to a revolutionary new paradigm
	for wireless ad hoc networking.},
