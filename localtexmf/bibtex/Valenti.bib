The iterative decoding of the RS product codes is based on the soft decoding and the soft decision of the component codes. The performance of RS turbo codes have been evaluated on the Gaussian and Rayleigh channels using Monte Carlo simulation. Coding gains up to 5.5 dB for a BER (bit error rate) of 10/sup -5/ have been obtained on the Gaussian channel.

When the receiver has perfect knowledge of the channel, the scheme offers only marginal improvement in performance over optimum linear coded modulation with Viterbi or reduced search detection. However, the improvement is significantly higher when the detector is mismatched, i.e., if it uses an imperfect channel estimate. The delay is low since the block sizes are small and the performance improvement is achieved with few iterations. The technique may be applied as a retransmission strategy in order to save power for systems that suffer from losses due to ISI and channel mismatch (6 Refs.)},

Such enumerating describes fairly well the sequences generated by a non-recursive encoder but fails to do so for recursive ones where merging with the all-0 path is not the general case. We especially consider recursive pseudo-random convolutional codes, the generator matrix of which contains at least a rational fraction having as denominator a primitive polynomial. For such codes, the paths which merge with the all-0 one are fewer, the larger is the constraint length. We cursorily show that the weight distribution thus obtained is close to that of random coding. However, a practical decoder does not take into account the probabilities of the coded sequences, which belong to the same set whether the encoder is recursive or not. Decoding a pseudo-random code thus demands that the information sequences are restricted to some distinctive subset, which is achieved by concatenation. We examine how to combine two or more such encoders according to the turbo- code scheme (13 Refs.)},

annote={A random-like code is designed so as to make its normalized distance distribution close to that obtained in the average by random coding. The iterated product of single-parity- check codes, for testing the use of several successive weighted-output decodings in order to reduce the overall decoding complexity, was the first example of a random-like code with a poor minimum distance but a good bit-error rate. A distinction is introduced between strongly and weakly random-like codes. Strongly random-like codes are such that each term of their weight distribution is close to that of random coding, in contrast with weakly random-like ones which exhibit only a global shape similarity. Strongly random-like codes are good for the minimum distance criterion as meeting the Gilbert-Varshamov bound and their word-error rate (WER) is good. In contrast, weakly random- like codes may have small bit-error rate (BER) but bad WER. From an engineering point of view, however, the BER is the most significant parameter so weakly random-like codes are actually interesting. Moreover, their design is easier. We briefly review some codes which may be considered as random- like, with special emphasis on so-called "pseudo-random" systematic convolutional codes which are recursive and such that the recursive part of the encoder corresponds to a maximum-length generator. Even if such a code has a small free distance and thus does not result in a low enough BER, combining several such codes according to the turbo-code scheme enables control of the weight distribution tails, hence the BER, by increasing the number of combined codes, so as to meet any specified performance at a rate lower than the channel capacity (25 Refs.)},

For parallel concatenated trellis codes in the examples, rate 2/3 and 4/5, 8, and 16-state binary convolutional codes with Ungerboeck mapping by set partitioning (natural mapping), a reordered mapping, and Gray code mapping are used. The performance of these codes is within 1 dB from the Shannon limit at a bit error probability of 10/sup -7/ for a given throughput, which outperforms the performance of all codes reported in the past for the same throughput (10 Refs.)},

At each iteration, extrinsic information is extracted from the detection and decoding steps and is then used at the next iteration as in turbo- decoding. From the implementation point of view, the receiver can be structured in a modular way and its performance, in bit error rate terms, is directly related to the number of modules used.

For this reason, Monte-Carlo simulations based on measured mobile radio impulse responses are performed. As a reference to which TD can be compared, a one-dimensional convolutional code with soft-decision Viterbi decoding (VD) is alternatively used.

annote={Turbo codes are the most exciting and potentially important development in coding theory in many years. They were introduced in 1993 by Berrou, Glavieux and Thitimajshima, and claimed to achieve near Shannon-limit error correction performance with relatively simple component codes and large interleavers. A required E/sub b//N/sub o/ of 0.7 dB was reported for BER of 10/sup -5/ and code rate of 1/2. However, some important details that are necessary to reproduce these results were omitted. This paper confirms the accuracy of these claims, and presents a complete description of an encoder/decoder pair that could be suitable for PCS applications. We describe a new simple method for trellis termination, we analyze the effect of interleaver choice on the weight distribution of the code, and we introduce the use of unequal rate component codes which yields better performance. Turbo codes are extended to encoders with multiple codes and a suitable decoder structure is developed, which is substantially different from the decoder for two-code based encoders (10 Refs.)},

The receiver performs two successive soft-output decisions, achieved by a symbol detector and a channel decoder, through an iterative process. At each iteration, extrinsic information is extracted from the detection and decoding steps and is then used at the next iteration as in turbo- decoding. From the implementation point of view, the receiver can be structured in a modular way and its performance, in bit error rate terms, is directly related to the number of modules used. Simulation results are presented for transmissions on Gauss and Rayleigh channels. The results obtained show that turbo-equalization manages to overcome multipath effects, totally on Gauss channels, and partially but still satisfactorily on Rayleigh channels (5 Refs.)},

annote={Different concepts of iterative decoding algorithms for serial or parallel concatenated coding (called turbo-code) as well as for the special case of the generalized concatenated coding schemes have been introduced. These algorithms being very efficient, are based on soft output decoding, where, the soft decisions are used as feed-forward information for the next steps of iterations. In order to achieve the high performance expected by turbo-codes and to assume a great flexibility for the system, we combine a multilevel turbo-code with 8PSK modulation. This allow us to examine in detail the performance of this combination compared with different coding and decoding approaches: turbo-code with Gray mapping and iterative multistage decoding using convolutional codes or a combination of turbo codes, convolutional and single parity check codes. In all of our studies we consider a super-concatenated coding scheme, where the outer code is based on Reed-Solomon code. The results showed that the coding gain at a BER of 10/sup - 4/ (since we employ a powerful outer RS decoder) for the iterative convolutional coding and for the combination of convolutional/turbo coding is quite the same compared to turbo coding with Gray mapping, which is 0.5 dB. However, compared to uncoded QPSK, the coding gain is 4 dB (at a BER of 10/sup -4/), which is quite significant (11 Refs.)},

This gain for both coding schemes (BZ and turbo) using a soft-output Viterbi-decoding algorithm in AWGN and in Rayleigh-fading channels is 1.3 dB and 1.5 dB, respectively. Compared to uncoded BPSK, the coding gain for both schemes is much higher: 6.3 dB in AWGN and about 30 dB in a Rayleigh fading channel; which is quite significant (10 Refs.)},

annote={Recently, a new family of error correcting codes called turbo-codes, has been developed. An original auto- synchronisation method for these turbocodes is reported. This method ensures the timing synchronisation necessary to trigger the internal functions of turbo-decoders like interleaving or deinterleaving. This technique also takes into account elementary decoder synchronisation to remove any ambiguities about the position and/or the inversion of the symbols coming from the channel. The ambiguities due to demodulation are removed in the case of base band, BPSK and and PSK modulations. The two types of synchronisation are performed at the same time without any synchronisation word or any loss in the coding rate. A pseudo-syndrome concept for decoder supervision in the tracking phase is presented. The decoder is thus able to detect out-of-synchronisation reception and to start a new synchronisation search phase (4 Refs.)},

Convolutional codes as well as turbo codes are considered and their performance is compared to that of previously proposed Reed-Solomon (RS) codes. A mobile radio environment yielding a frequency selective fading channel is assumed. It is shown that the application of turbo codes and convolutional codes with soft decision decoding can allow for a considerably higher number of simultaneously transmitting users than RS codes or uncoded systems. To achieve these throughput gains, however, the calculation of soft decisions after de-spreading is mandatory; the pertinent technique is described in the paper (9 Refs.)},

annote={Iterative decoding of two-dimensional systematic convolutional codes has been termed "turbo" (de)coding. Using log-likelihood algebra, we show that any decoder can be used which accepts soft inputs-including a priori values- and delivers soft outputs that can be split into three terms: the soft channel and a priori inputs, and the extrinsic value. The extrinsic value is used as an a priori value for the next iteration. Decoding algorithms in the log- likelihood domain are given not only for convolutional codes but also for any linear binary systematic block code. The iteration is controlled by a stop criterion derived from cross entropy, which results in a minimal number of iterations. Optimal and suboptimal decoders with reduced complexity are presented. Simulation results show that very simple component codes are sufficient, block codes are appropriate for high rates and convolutional codes for lower rates less than 2/3. Any combination of block and convolutional component codes is possible. Several interleaving techniques are described. At a bit error rate (BER) of 10/sup -4/ the performance is slightly above or around the bounds given by the cutoff rate for reasonably simple block/convolutional component codes, interleaver sizes less than 1000 and for three to six iterations (29 Refs.)},

annote={Spread spectrum systems especially code division multiple access systems (CDMA) match very well with channel coding employing forward error correcting (FEC) methods. We will cover in this overview article some aspects of FEC channel coding in CDMA systems: CDMA/FEC systems can be viewed as concatenated schemes with inner and outer decoding. We will show how such a system can be improved by using a soft- in/soft-out decoder which transfers a soft decision from the inner to the outer decoder. Further improvement is gained by using another soft-in/soft-out decoder for the outer code. In an iteration the soft values of the outer code bits are then used as a priori values for the inner CDMA decoder/despreader. This can he supplemented by soft decoded bits from the other users' outer decoder similar to an interference cancellation scheme. Applications to the IS 95 system with Hadamard codes show a remarkable gain from the soft-output and from the iterations. Turbo' decoding of two and more dimensional product-like codes with iterative decoding using soft-in/soft-out' decoders achieves almost channel capacity. We extend this concept to CDMA systems with PN spreading sequences where FEC coding in one dimension is performed in the time direction and FEC coding in the other dimension is performed by a systematic code in the CDMA code direction. The parity bits of this code are transmitted by extra CDMA codes. The additional interference degradation caused hereby is outweighted by the extra FEC coding gain achieved by iterative decoding (16 Refs.)},

annote={In this correspondence we are concerned with the error rates contributed by component codes in a multilevel code, decoded by a multistage decoder. These error rates are required for estimating the performance of the structure, but more importantly, they can serve as a design tool for achieving high coding gain. The latter objective can be reached by approaching a balance among these error rates. For evaluating the error rate contributed by a component code, it is essential to calculate the corresponding spectrum of Euclidean distances. A method for computing this spectrum is developed in this correspondence. The method is general and applicable to any signal constellation, and convolutional as well as block component codes. The error coefficient, available in the literature for some multilevel codes with an infinite size signal constellation, is shown to be significantly different from that of a practical finite constellation. Note that the complete spectrum is essential when codewords (of a component code) with Hamming distance beyond the minimum distance affect the error rate (see, e.g., Turbo codes) (18 Refs.)},

annote={Turbo codes provide greater coding gain than commonly used convolutional codes. The maximum a-posteriori turbo decoder, unlike the Viterbi decoder often used for convolutional codes, explicitly uses E/sub b//N/sub 0/ as a parameter in the decoding process. We have investigated the effects of errors in estimating the E/sub b//N/sub 0/ on turbo code bit error rate (BER) performance in additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels and binary symmetric channels (BSCs). Both small (220 bit) and large (65535 bit) buffers have been tested. For a BSC without any E/sub b//N/sub 0/ estimation error, the small buffer turbo code yields a BER of 10/sup - 3/ at an E/sub b//N/sub 0/ of 3.9 dB and the large buffer turbo code yields a BER of 10/sup -5/ at an E/sub b//N/sub 0/ of 3 dB. The small interleaver turbo code operating over a two link satellite demod/remod channel produces a net BER of 10/sup -3/ with an uplink E/sub b//N/sub 0/ of 5 dB and a downlink E/sub b//N/sub 0/ of 6.6 dB. When E/sub b//N/sub 0/ estimation errors are included in the AWGN or BSCs, the results indicate that errors of up to several dB can be tolerated before the onset of significant degradation in turbo code performance (9 Refs.)},

Especially in the down-link OFDM-CDMA enables low complexity mobile receivers since OFDM can prevent intersymbol interference (ISI), and thus reduce the complexity of a RAKE receiver in a multipath channel. In this paper an OFDM-CDMA system combined with convolutional and turbo channel coding is investigated for the down-link. We derive the optimal soft value-the so called log- likelihood ratio-for the Viterbi decoding algorithm, applied in the OFDM-CDMA system. Based on this derivation we present the performance of an OFDM-CDMA system with channel coding. The investigations are carried out for conventional detection with minimum mean square error (MMSE) equalization and for joint detection with maximum likelihood sequence estimation (MLSE). The various combinations between detection techniques and decoding schemes enable a comparison between achievable system performance and necessary system complexity (11 Refs.)},

annote={An optimal interleaving between two component encoders of a turbo-code is proposed. The optimality criterion for any real constructable interleaver is given. For component codes with known weight distribution (WD), the WD of the turbo- code with optimal interleaving is calculated. Furthermore, a method for approximate calculation of the WD of convolutional code with terminated feed-forward and feed- back encoders is proposed. Using this WD's and proposed interleaving, the union upper bounds on the bit error rate of the turbo-code are given. It is shown that the often observed "break" in the performance curves of turbo-codes is a result of their "broken" WD. For component codes lying on the Gilbert-Varshamov bound, an upper bound on the ratio between the minimum distance of the turbo-code and the component code is determined. The lower bounds on the signal- to-noise ratio needed to achieve error free decoding of turbo-codes with random component coders are given. These bounds are compared with the Shannon limit and analogous bounds for random codes (16 Refs.)},

The size of this circuit is roughly twice that of the original soft output Viterbi decoder while the speed is increased by a factor of 2. Because of its performances, this circuit is very attractive for satellite digital communication systems and is at the root of "turbo-codes", which are a class of convolutional codes whose performances in terms of bit error rate, are close to the Shannon limit (8 Refs.)},

annote={The use of coherent receiver antenna diversity (CRAD) in combination with powerful channel coding is advisable in order to obtain sufficient quality in digital mobile radio systems. The application of both CRAD and a novel convolutional code termed the turbo-code to the uplink of a joint detection (JD) code division multiple access (CDMA) mobile radio system is considered. New results on the coded error performance obtained by using the well-known powerful JD techniques zero forcing block decision feedback equalization, minimum mean square error block linear equalization, and minimum mean square error block decision feedback equalization, which were extended to CRAD with maximal-ratio combining, are presented when either one or two receiver antennas are applied. Both bit and frame error rates, respectively, are introduced and compared with formerly published results. The performance enhancement is demonstrated. Furthermore, it is shown that there is a linear dependence between the bit as well as frame error rate and the variance of the log-likelihood ratios generated by the turbo-code decoder. Therefore, the turbo-code decoder can provide information about the current system performance by estimating the variance of the log-likelihood ratios (19 Refs.)},

annote={Different concepts of iterative decoding algorithms for multi-dimensional coding, serial or parallel concatenated coding (called Turbo-code) as well as for the case of generalized concatenated coding schemes have previously been introduced. In order to achieve high performance expected by Turbo-codes and to assume a great flexibility, the present authors combine multilevel Turbo-code with a high order of modulation. This allows examination of the performance of this combination compared with different coding and decoding approaches: Turbo-code with Gray mapping and iterative multistage decoding using Turbo codes or convolutional coding. The authors consider a super-concatenated coding scheme, where the outer code is based on Reed-Solomon code. As modulation they use multi-resolution (MR) modulation (a potential candidate for hierarchical digital TV/HDTV for terrestrial broadcasting). The performance of these three approaches are presented for the three hierarchy layers (SDTV, EDTV and HDTV). All these coding scheme have the same average coding rates. The number of iterations for Turbo code of memory 4 with interleaver size 2048, is 3. However, for convolutional code of memory 6 the number of iterations considered is 1. The results showed that the coding gain at BER of 4*10/sup -4/ for the three approaches are the same compared to a convolutional coding with Gray mapping. However, the small gain of Turbo-multilevel code with respect to the Turbo-Gray mapping case is due to the "error propagation" after re-encoding for multistage detection (12 Refs.)},

annote={We show that the soft output of the soft-output Viterbi- decoder (SOVA) suffers from two distortions. Firstly, for bad channels the reliability information of the decoder output is too optimistic. The output can be considered as being multiplied by a factor, that depends on the current bit-error-rate (BER). To become closer to the true log- likelihood ratio the output has to be normalized. Secondly, the soft-output of the SOVA-when used in Turbo decoding-is effected by a correlation between the so called extrinsic and intrinsic information. Since the extrinsic information is fed forward to be the a-priori information in the next decoding stage and is treated as being uncorrelated with the systematic-information, a correcting term has to be introduced in order to compensate this correlation. We show how these distortions can be corrected and we apply the correcting measures on the SOVA that is used as component decoder of a Turbo-code scheme. Finally, we provide simulation results that illustrate the gain due to normalizing the extrinsic information and exploiting the correlation in the soft output (8 Refs.)},

The "error floor" that occurs at moderate signal-to-noise ratios is shown to be a consequence of the relatively low free distance of the code. It is also shown that the "error floor" can be lowered by increasing the size of the interleaver without changing the free distance of the code. Alternatively, the free distance of the code may be increased by using primitive feedback polynomials. The excellent performance of turbo codes at low signal-to-noise ratios is explained in terms of the distance spectrum. The interleaver in the turbo encoder is shown to reduce the number of low-weight codewords through a process called "spectral thinning." This thinned distance spectrum results in the free distance asymptote being the dominant performance parameter for low and moderate signal-to-noise ratios (45 Refs.)},

annote={Recently, a coding scheme (turbo-codes) was proposed, that achieves almost reliable data communication at signal-to- noise ratios very close to the Shannon-limit. In this paper we show that the associated iterative decoder can be formulated in a simpler fashion by passing information from one decoder to the next using log-likelihood ratios as opposed to channel values that need to be normalized. This is in accordance with the MAP derivation of the component decoders. A drawback of the codes has been discovered: the BER curves show a flattening at higher signal-to-noise ratios, this is due to the small minimum distance of the whole code. By analyzing the interleaver used in the encoder we can calculate approximations to the BER at high SNRs. Finally, by careful interleaver manipulation the minimum distance of the code can be increased and the error- coefficient for the remaining small distance events can be further reduced. Furthermore, we have investigated the influence of the interleaver length on the SNR needed to achieve a certain BER; short lengths might be encountered in mobile and personal communications systems (e.g. voice transmission). Simulations confirm both the analytical approximation to the BER as well as the method for interleaver design which yields a marked improvement at higher SNR (7 Refs.)},

We show that the associated iterative decoder can be formulated in a simpler fashion by passing information from one decoder to the next using log- likelihood ratios as opposed to channel values that need to be normalized. Also no heuristically determined correction parameters are necessary for stable decoding. In addition, we can reduce the average number of iterations needed for the same BER performance by determining when further iterations achieve no more benefit. Furthermore, it seems that the trellis-termination problem appears non-trivial and we give a pragmatic suboptimal solution. We investigate different block sizes and also a hybrid scheme that performs extremely well with less computations.

annote={For estimating the states or outputs of a Markov process, the symbol-by-symbol MAP algorithm is optimal. However, this algorithm, even in its recursive form, poses technical difficulties because of numerical representation problems, the necessity of nonlinear functions and a high number of additions and multiplications. MAP like algorithms operating in the logarithmic domain presented in the past solve the numerical problem and reduce the computational complexity, but are suboptimal especially at low SNR (a common example is the max-log-MAP because of its use of the max function). A further simplification yields the soft-output Viterbi algorithm (SOVA). We present a log-MAP algorithm that avoids the approximations in the max-log-MAP algorithm and hence is equivalent to the true MAP, but without its major disadvantages. We compare the (log-)MAP, max-log-MAP and SOVA from a theoretical point of view to illuminate their commonalities and differences. As a practical example forming the basis for simulations, we consider Turbo decoding, where recursive systematic convolutional component codes are decoded with the three algorithms, and we also demonstrate the practical suitability of the log-MAP by including quantization effects. The SOVA is, at 10/sup -4/, approximately 0.7 dB inferior to the (log-)MAP, the max-log- MAP lying roughly in between. We also present some complexity comparisons and conclude that the three algorithms increase in complexity in the order of their optimality (10 Refs.)},

annote={We have investigated a novel bandwidth efficient channel coding scheme that has a code structure similar to binary turbo codes but employs Ungerboeck codes as component codes. The combination of turbo codes with powerful bandwidth efficient component codes leads to a straightforward encoder structure and allows iterative decoding in analogy to the binary turbo decoder. However, certain special conditions need to be met at the encoder, and the iterative decoder needs to be adapted to the decoding of the component Ungerboeck codes. The scheme has been investigated for 8 PSK and 16 QAM modulation, for which a first attempt at component code optimization was performed. Simulation results are presented and the scheme is compared with Ungerboeck codes on their own and also turbo codes with Gray mapping. The results show that the novel scheme is markedly superior at comparable complexity (10 Refs.)},

annote={The performance of TURBO codes is addressed by examining the distance spectrum. The error floor' is shown to be a consequence of the relatively low free distance of the code. It is also shown that the error floor' can be lowered by increasing the size of the interleaver. The excellent performance of TURBO codes at low signal-to-noise ratios is explained in terms of the distance spectrum. The interleaver in the TURBO encoder is shown to reduce the number of low weight codewords through a process called spectral thinning'. This thinned distance spectrum results in the free distance asymptote being the dominant performance parameter for low and moderate signal-to-noise ratios. Finally, it is shown that for a fixed interleaver size, the performance of TURBO codes may be improved by using a primitive polynomial as the feedback polynomial in the encoder (7 Refs.)},

annote={Until recently, most known decoding procedures for error- correcting codes were based either on algebraically calculating the error pattern or on some sort of tree or trellis search. With the advent of turbo coding, a third decoding principle has finally had its breakthrough: iterative decoding. With respect to Viterbi decoding, a code is most naturally described by means of a trellis diagram. The main thesis of the present paper is that, with respect to iterative decoding, the natural way of describing a code is by means of a Tanner graph, which may be viewed as a generalized trellis. More precisely, it is the "time axis" of a trellis that is generalized to a Tanner graph (4 Refs.)},

annote={A general framework, based on ideas of Tanner, for the description of codes and iterative decoding ("turbo coding") is developed. Just like trellis-based code descriptions are naturally matched to Viterbi decoding, code descriptions based on Tanner graphs (which may be viewed as generalized trellises) are naturally matched to iterative decoding. Two basic iterative decoding algorithms (which are versions of the algorithms of Berrou et al. and of Hagenauer, respectively) are shown to be natural generalizations of the forward-backward algorithm (Bahl et al.) and the Viterbi algorithm, respectively, to arbitrary Tanner graphs. The careful derivation of these algorithms clarifies, in particular, which a priori probabilities are admissible and how they are properly dealt with. For cycle codes (a class of binary linear block codes), a complete characterization is given of the error patterns that are corrected by the generalized Viterbi algorithm after infinitely many iterations (21 Refs.)},

The problems of frame synchronisation, noise variance estimation and metric optimisation have been solved in order to implement the modem.
