= Introduction =

The Coded Modulation Library (CML) is a library of communication
system simulations developed at WVU.

  * Implemented using MATLAB and C-mex
  * Free software licensed under the lesser GPL


== Brief List of Features ==
  * *Modulation*: PSK, QAM, APSK, CPM (CPFSK)

  * *Channel models*: AWGN, ergodic Rayleigh, block Rayleigh
 
 * *Channel Coding*: convolutional, turbo, BTC, LDPC, Hybrid-ARQ
    * User-specified LDPC parity-check matrices

  * *Information theoretic bounds*: channel capacity, outage probability

  * *Two-way relay channel physical-layer network coding*: noncoherent FSK relay receiver

A detailed list of features can be found [CmlFeatures here].
