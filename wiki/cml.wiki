= Introduction =

The Coded Modulation Library (CML) is a library of communication
system simulations developed at WVU.

  * Implemented using MATLAB and C-mex
  * Free software licensed under the lesser GPL


== Brief List of Features ==
  * Modulation: PSK, QAM, APSK, CPM (CPFSK)
  * Channel models: AWGN, ergodic Rayleigh, block Rayleigh
  * Channel Coding: convolutional, turbo, BTC, LDPC, Hybrid-ARQ
  * User-specified LDPC parity-check matrices
  * Information theoretic bounds: channel capacity, outage probability
  * Two-way relay channel phyical-layer network coding: noncoherent FSK relay receiver
